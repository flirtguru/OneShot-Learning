# OneShot-Learning
Various Methods are used for performing one-shot learning like:

1)Siamese Networks

2)MAN's

## 1) Siamese Networks

Siamese Networks are a special type of neural network in which it differentiates the input from other classes by generating an encoded vector matrix and then comparing them with other encoded matrices to 
predict its own class.

Eg:Siamese networks only need 1 image of the subject to recognize it in the future.

Here both the inputs are passed through the same neural network(same architecture,same weights) and then the resultant outputs are compared
and our input is classified with the one having the minimum contrastive loss.


## 2) MAN....
